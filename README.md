# Computerize_Timetable
During summer break of 2015, college has organised a Vocational Training for 3rd year students and I have joined CMC Academy (http://www.cmcacademy.com/) for that training and during this training I worked on a project of Computerized Timetable.
I have build this project in C language. 

Here is the report ( [Udit_Raikwar (udit043).pdf](https://github.com/udit043/Computerize_Timetable/files/76620/Udit_Raikwar.udit043.pdf) )
Here is the executable file (https://db.tt/39MOwc3A [win-7-64bit]).
